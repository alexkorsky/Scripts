You can think of a DataFrame as a group of Series that share an index.
This makes it easy to select specific columns that you want from the 
DataFrame. 

Also a couple pointers:
1) Selecting a single column from the DataFrame will return a Series
2) Selecting multiple columns from the DataFrame will return a DataFrame

    print (football['year'])
    print ('')
    print (football.year)  # shorthand for football['year'])
    print ('')
    print (football[['year', 'wins', 'losses']])

Row selection can be done through multiple ways.

Some of the basic and common methods are:
   1) Slicing
   2) An individual index (through the functions iloc or loc)
   3) Boolean indexing

You can also combine multiple selection requirements through boolean
operators like & (and) or | (or)
